# Introduction

I would like to see something like [aisafety.world](https://aisafety.world/) for biosecurity. There already exists the [Map of Biosecurity Interventions](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/npNt43QRnaRNRixXK/map-of-biosecurity-interventions), but I want one for organizations!

This is a work-in-progress attempt to create a minimum viable product.** Please suggest/comment on additional information, and feel free to add your name to the list of contributors. **

Also, see [this Substack newsletter](https://gcbrupdates.substack.com/), “GCBR Organization Updates,” which provides a very useful overview and quarterly updates of biosecurity organizations.

# Technical R&D

  

_While there are GCBR-focused or EA-aligned organizations working directly on technical biosecurity interventions, the majority of relevant work is being done in academia and, to a lesser extent, industry/startups. A strong tail-risk awareness is still very relevant in policy, but after having identified promising technical interventions, it is now more important to interface with existing domain expertise. We’d thus recommend newcomers interested in working on technical biosecurity to explore traditional careers focussed on relevant biosecurity-relevant R&D._
